Continuing on the subject of - [There is no free will](https://github.com/jellAIfish/jellyfish/issues/47). Some time ago I came across a paper based on cognitive neuroscience - [Unconscious determinants of free - decisions in the human brain](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4210/c1714c88cec8c856dfd1535b22ee29fd1af0.pdf). To give a brief overview on the paper, the abstract says -
> There has been a long controversy as to whether subjectively
‘free’ decisions are determined by brain activity ahead of
time. We found that the outcome of a decision can be encoded
in brain activity of prefrontal and parietal cortex up to 10 s
before it enters awareness. This delay presumably reflects
the operation of a network of high-level control areas that
begin to prepare an upcoming decision long before it
enters awareness.

The experiment which they conducted was as followed -

Avoiding the detailed discussion on the paper, this study certainly proves upto some extent that free will is a mere illusion. Our behaviour, our actions are nothing but effect of [butterfly theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) -
> the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly several weeks earlier.

One can easily find the analogy between the above experiment and butterfly effect or even [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). In conclusion our universe is nothing but a non-linear deterministic model which very well can be a science project of a super intelligent race.

> Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.

The chaotic human behaviour is so succeptible to such approximate changes that it is beyond our limits to have free will.
